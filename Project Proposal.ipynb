    "# Title: Predicting the Performance of a Student\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A student's performance is not only influenced by how hard they work; it can be affected by many factors, including school quality, relationships, health conditions, and so on. The question is, how can one accurately predict the performance of a student?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a dataset made by Paulo Cortez, we are able to answer the question above. The dataset contains data collected using school reports and questionnaires from two Portuguese secondary schools, and includes the first period, second period, and final grades of numerous students. It also tracks various social and health related information, ranging from family situations to alcohol consumption. Since the original dataset includes too many variables to reasonably consider, the variables we use has been filtered and narrowed down to a manageable amount. In this project, we are only interested in predicting a student's math performance."

Thus, predicting a student's performance in classes besides math is a question for the future.\n",
